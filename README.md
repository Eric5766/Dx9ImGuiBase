A (Somewhat) minimal implementation of a DX9 hook which implements a barebones ImGui menu. 

Templating as an easy starting point for different projects.

Utilises .dll hijacking, no need for injectors, just drag and drop direct8input.dll alongside the game executable and it will be loaded on launch.
